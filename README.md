# Sales Analysis: Unlocking Growth in Contractor Staffing

## üìå Project Background
Clipboard Health has a nationwide opportunity to expand its contractor staffing services, but not all nursing homes rely on contractors equally. Some facilities face staff shortages, while others primarily use full-time employees‚Äîpotential untapped markets.

By analyzing 2024 Q2 PBJ staffing data and other CMS datasets, we can identify high-demand regions, understaffed facilities, and homes with low contractor utilization. This data-driven approach will help the sales team prioritize outreach, maximize impact, and grow Clipboard Health‚Äôs market share in the contractor staffing space.
This project analyzes staffing trends within a sales-driven organization to understand workforce allocation, efficiency, and cost management. The company has been active for 9 years and operates in the healthcare sector. It follows a hybrid workforce model, utilizing both contracted and full-time employees to meet business demands.

Key business metrics include:
- **Total staffing hours** (contractors vs. employees)
- **Ratio of contractor to employee hours**
- **Seasonal variations in staffing patterns**
- **Impact of staffing structure on sales performance**

As a Data Analyst at Clipboard Health, the goal is to evaluate workforce trends and optimize staffing decisions for operational efficiency.

## Executive Summary
**Key Findings:**
1. **Contractor hours exhibit seasonal variations** with spikes in peak sales periods.
2. **Full-time employees contribute to baseline staffing stability**, but contractor dependency fluctuates.
3. **A higher contractor-to-employee ratio correlates with increased short-term sales but may impact long-term cost efficiency.**
