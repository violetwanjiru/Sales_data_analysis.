# Sales Analysis: Unlocking Growth in Contractor Staffing

## üìå Project Background
Clipboard Health has a nationwide opportunity to expand its contractor staffing services, but not all nursing homes rely on contractors equally. Some facilities face staff shortages, while others primarily use full-time employees‚Äîpotential untapped markets.

By analyzing 2024 Q2 PBJ staffing data and other CMS datasets, we can identify high-demand regions, understaffed facilities, and homes with low contractor utilization. This data-driven approach will help the sales team prioritize outreach, maximize impact, and grow Clipboard Health‚Äôs market share in the contractor staffing space.
This project analyzes staffing trends within a sales-driven organization to understand workforce allocation, efficiency, and cost management. The company has been active for 9 years and operates in the healthcare sector. It follows a hybrid workforce model, utilizing both contracted and full-time employees to meet business demands.

Key business metrics include:
- **Total staffing hours** (contractors vs. employees)
- **Ratio of contractor to employee hours**
- **Seasonal variations in staffing patterns**
- **Impact of staffing structure on sales performance**

As a Data Analyst at Clipboard Health, the goal is to evaluate workforce trends and optimize staffing decisions for operational efficiency.

## Executive Summary
**Key Findings:**
1. **Many nursing homes underutilize contractors, presenting growth opportunities.** Nearly 40% of facilities rely heavily on full-time employees. Expanding awareness of contractor benefits can drive adoption.
2. **Certain states show lower contractor utilization, signalling untapped markets.**
3. **Staffing volatility creates a need for more stable workforce solutions.** Facilities with high fluctuations in staffing can benefit from contractor staffing to maintain operational stability.
4. **Nursing homes already using contractors represent retention and expansion opportunities.** 
5. **Lower-rated facilities rely more on contractors, offering a unique value proposition.**

##  Recommendations
Based on these insights, the **Sales Team** should consider:

1. **Expand Contractor Awareness in Employee-Heavy Facilities** - Nearly 40% of nursing homes rely primarily on full-time employees, but they may struggle with unexpected staffing shortages.
2.  **Unlock Growth in Underserved States** ‚Äì Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, and Nevada have the lowest contractor utilization. Target these states with data-driven outreach, demonstrating contractor staffing reduces overtime costs and ensures compliance. Use case studies to build trust.
3. **Stabilize Workforce at High-Fluctuation Facilities** ‚Äì Facilities like Marigold Rehabilitation HCC experience staffing volatility. Position contractor staffing as a solution for consistent workforce planning, reducing uncertainty and improving efficiency.
4. **Strengthen Relationships with Contractor-Preferred Facilities** ‚Äì Nursing homes like Isabela Geriatric Centre already embrace contractors. Differentiate our staffing solution by emphasizing superior quality, faster fulfilment, and cost advantages to secure long-term contracts.
5. **Support Low-Rated Facilities with Strategic Staffing** ‚Äì Lower-rated facilities rely more on contractors, likely due to retention and compliance issues. Offer a consultative approach to help stabilize operations, reduce turnover, and improve CMS ratings with a tailored contractor staffing plan.
